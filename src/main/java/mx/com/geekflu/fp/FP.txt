imperative style, which means that the concrete statements 
— which manipulate state and behaviour — are written out explicitly.

A few signals of very imperative (procedural) code:
	1.- Focus on how to perform the task
	2.- State changes and order of execution is important
	3.- Many loops and conditionals

The code clearly focuses on the “How” — which makes the “What” hard to determine.

I can easily see what’s going on if I write my code in a more functional style, 
which saves me time (because yes, I do read code 90% of the time instead of 
writing it) and writing it like this is less error-prone, 
because less lines gives less opportunity for bugs to hide.
