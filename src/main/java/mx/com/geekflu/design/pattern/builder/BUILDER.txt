Motivation
	
	some objects are simple and can be created by calling a constructor
	Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create them
	Having a 10 argument constructor is not very productive instead we should for a
	piecewise construction, allowing people to construct an object piece by piece
	Builder provides an API for constructing and object step by step
